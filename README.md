# Krishna's SDE Journey 🚀

Welcome to my public repository where I track everything I'm doing to become a Software Development Engineer (SDE).

## 📚 Current Focus:
- Java (Apna College Series)
- DSA (LeetCode + GFG)
- Internship Projects (Java / MERN)

## 📁 Repo Structure:
- `DSA-Java/` → Daily problem solving (LeetCode)
- `Java-Learning/` → Concept practice (OOPs, Patterns, etc.)
- `Projects/` → Full stack or mini projects

Stay tuned. I'm coding every day. 💪  
Let's build something amazing!
